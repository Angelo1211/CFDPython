# 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes: Building a CFD Solver in Python.

![Alt text](/images/poisson.png "Poisson's Equation in 2D. As seen in Step 10.")

This repo contains my work done to build a simple CFD solver in Python following the interactive module [12 Steps to Navier Stokes](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython) created by Professor [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/). I wrote a brief article on my website that goes over the background for this project and showcases some of the skills I picked up on the process which you can take a look at [here](http://www.aortiz.me/portfolio/4_project/). The main goal of the project was to build a Navier-Stokes solver in Python that will serve as the foundation for all of my future endeavours into CFD. I learned much in the process and even set out to not only complete the course but give it my own spin. With that in mind I set off to animate all of the plots that we build in the course so that you can have a better understanding of the time history evolution of the simulations.

Here's a few of my favorite animations::
